Android app to recognize emotions in live video feed and objects and text in still images to help visually impaired people using the voice feedback.


Just build the app and install it on your android phone.

Notes

     - For proper working of the app, the phone has to be connected to the internet.

     - The text and object detection is temporarily down due to server issues. Will be running shortly.
     
     - The project was initially made for Rajasthan Hackathon and Uploaded on Github on 7th July, 2018.
